SETUP
First I created three components (Tours, Tour and Loading), you can create three separate files in your project directory: Tours.jsx, Tour.jsx and Loading.jsx. In each of these files, I defined a React functional component that returns JSX code to render that component.

Fetch Tours
The Tour component will be responsible for creating a list of the Tour components. In App.jsx, retrieving tour data from a URL using the fetch API. Before the data is loaded, I have shown a loading spinner or message that can be implemented using the Loading component.

Render Tours
After the data is loaded, I set the state of the component to store the tour data. Next, I mapped the array of laps and created a Tour component for each lap. Each Tour component will rig the tour data, including the tour's ID, picture, information, name and price.

Remove Tour
To implement the "remove tour" functionality, you can add a button to each Tour component that, when clicked, removes the tour from the list of tours. You can achieve this by updating the state of the Tours component to remove the tour from the tours array.

Re-fetch Tours
Finally, I implemented a "re-fetch" functionality by adding a button or other UI element that, when clicked, re-fetches the tour data from the URL and updates the state of the Tours component.

In general, the flow of the application should look like this:

App.jsx gets the tour data from a URL and sets the state of the Tours component to store the data.

The Tours component maps the series of laps and creates a Tour component for each lap.

Each Tour component has a "remove tour" button and a "read more" button. When the "Remove tour" button is clicked, the Tours component updates its status to remove the tour from the tours array.

When the "read more" button is clicked, the Tour component updates its state to change the "read more" flag and conditionally renders the full description.

Clicking the "Retrieve" button, the Tours component re-fetches the tour data from the URL and updates its status.
